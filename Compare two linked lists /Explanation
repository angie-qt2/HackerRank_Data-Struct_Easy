The problem that HackerRank gave me is called Compare two linked lists.
In this problem, the function name is CompareLists; this function has two inputs, head1 and head2, it represent the starting nodes of two linked lists.
base on the problem given, the function must check if the two linked lists are exactly the same.
To solve this, I used a while loop that goes through both lists at the same time, checking if the data in each pair of nodes is equal.
If at any point the values are not the same, the function immediately "returns false;".
After finishing the loop, I check if both lists ended at the same time.
If both are null at the end, meaning they have the same length and same values, the function returns (current1 == null && current2 == null;) true; otherwise, it returns false.
